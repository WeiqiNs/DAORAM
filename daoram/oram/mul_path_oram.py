"""
This module defines the path oram class.

Path oram has two public methods:
    - init_storage_on_pos_map: this should be called first after the class object is created. This method constructs the
        storage the server should hold for the client.
    - operate_on_key: after the server gets the created storage, the client can use this function to obliviously access
        data points stored in the storage.
