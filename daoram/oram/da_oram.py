"""
This module defines the DAOram (De-Amortized Oram) class.

DAOram has three public methods:
    - init_storage_on_pos_map: this should be called first after the class object is created. This method constructs the
        storage the server should hold for the client.
    - compress_pos_map: this should be called after the storage is initialized as this will destroy the initial position
        map and compress it to a list of oram.
    - operate_on_key: after the server gets the created storage, the client can use this function to obliviously access
        data points stored in the storage.

By default, we assume the position map oram stores 512-bit values. We set the optimized parameters and have a
compression ratio of 1/64.
