"""
This module defines the recursive path oram class.

Recursive path oram has three public methods:
    - init_storage_on_pos_map: this should be called first after the class object is created. This method constructs the
        storage the server should hold for the client.
    - compress_pos_map: this should be called after the storage is initialized as this will destroy the initial position
        map and compress it to a list of oram. The compression rate by default is set to 1/4.
    - operate_on_key: after the server gets the created storage, the client can use this function to obliviously access
        data points stored in the storage.
